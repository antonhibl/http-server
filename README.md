# HTTP Server built with Go
#### *Author: Anton Hibl*

-----

I will be documenting myself building and designing an http web server
which will be used to serve my personal website at some point. I will be
using Go for most of the server side coding and javascript along with some
Rust and WebAssembly for the front end.
